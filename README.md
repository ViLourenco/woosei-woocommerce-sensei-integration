# WooCommerce Sensei Integration
This is a custom plugin build for some companies to buy online courses, create users for your employees and give them acess to the course bought. Only companies that has CNPJ (Brazilian code to legal person) can do it.

When some course is bought by a company, a form will be displayed in their "My Account" page, enabling to create users and give the access to the course.

Still in Portuguese but I'll translate.

Contributes are welcome!
